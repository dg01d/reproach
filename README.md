### Installation 

```
$ cd your_site_repo/
$ mkdir themes
$ cd themes
$ git clone https://github.com/dg01d/reproach
```

See the [official Hugo themes documentation](http://gohugo.io/themes/installing) for mor
e info.

### Features

Right now it features such delights as:

Brutalist - It is the very definition of Brutalist Web Design.
Minimalist - You can't really get more minimal than a zero-length page render!

Actual features will be added here as I add them to the theme.

### Usage

This theme expects a relatively standard Hugo blog/personal site layout:
```
.
└── content
    ├── post
    |   ├── post1.md
    |   └── post2.md
    ├── license.md        // For the love of reason, licence _your_ work!
    └── other_page.md
```

Just run `hugo --theme=hyde-x` to generate your site!
